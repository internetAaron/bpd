    <h3>What Is A Pediatric Dentist?</h3>
    <p>A pediatric dentist has at least 2 years of specialized training beyond the four years of dental school and is dedicated to the oral health of all children, including those with special needs.  Dr. Taylor, Dr. Gierke, and Dr. Patangan have undergone rigorous, voluntary examination to become experts in the field of pediatric dentistry.  Because of their unique training and natural desire to help kids, our doctors are well-qualified to care for your child.</p>

    <h3>Why Are The Primary Teeth Important?</h3>
    <p>Primary teeth are not “just baby teeth.” Neglected primary teeth increase cavity risk which often leads to problems with developing permanent teeth.</p> 

    <hr>

    <h3>Primary teeth are important to:</h3>
    <ul class="leaf">
      <li><p>Allow for proper chewing and eating</p></li>
      <li><p>Hold space for permanent teeth as they move into the correct position</p></li>
      <li><p>Permit normal development of the jaw bones and muscles</p></li>
      <li><p>Aid in the development of speech</p></li>
      <li><p>Add to an attractive appearance</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>While front teeth last until 6-8 years of age, back teeth (canines and molars) aren’t replaced until age 10-12. In other words, kids need their primary teeth for a long time.</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>When will my baby start getting teeth?</h3>
    <p>Children’s teeth usually start erupting at age 6 months, but this varies depending on the child.  Occasional ‘teething’ pain can happen from about 6 months until around age 3, after all 20 primary teeth have erupted.  Permanent teeth begin appearing around age 6, starting with the first molars in the back and lower central incisors in the front.  The eruption of permanent teeth continues until approximately age 21.</p>
    <p>Adults have 28 permanent teeth, or up to 32 including the third molars, commonly referred to as wisdom teeth.</p>

    <h3>Dental Radiographs (X-Rays)</h3>
    <p>Radiographs (X-Rays) are a vital and necessary part of your child’s dental diagnostic process and are usually taken once a year.  Without them, certain dental conditions can and will be missed.  Radiographs detect much more than cavities. For example, radiographs may be needed to survey erupting teeth, diagnose bone diseases, evaluate the results of an injury, or plan orthodontic treatment. Radiographs allow dentists to diagnose and treat health conditions that cannot be detected during a visual exam. If dental problems are found and treated early, dental care is more comfortable for your child and more affordable for you.  In accordance with the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, our office recommends taking radiographs based on the needs of the individual child. Some children have multiple risk factors which make them very susceptible to cavities. Therefore, these children need to be followed very closely and may need more frequent radiographs.  Pediatric dentists are particularly careful to minimize the exposure of their patients to radiation.  With contemporary safeguards, the amount of radiation received in a dental X-ray examination is extremely small.  Dental radiographs represent a far smaller health risk than do undetected and untreated dental problems.</p>

    <h3>When should I start using fluoride toothpaste?</h3>
    <p>Along with the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD), we recommend using fluoride toothpaste for all ages. Routine topical fluoride exposure, as is done with brushing, is one of the most effective ways to prevent cavities. When young children are properly supervised, risk of problems due to fluoride ingestion is negligible.  New research shows that the right time to start using fluoride toothpaste is as soon as you see teeth in your baby’s mouth.  Use only a smear – enough to cover only a couple of the bristles on the tooth brush.  Your baby can swallow all of that without any concern of getting too much fluoride.  Once your child is two years old, you can start using a pea size amount.  Always treat fluoride toothpaste like a medicine and make sure you keep it out of young children’s reach.  A parent should always apply the toothpaste to the toothbrush.</p>

    <h3>Does Your Child Grind His Teeth At Night? (Bruxism)</h3>
    <p>Parents are often concerned about the nocturnal grinding of teeth (bruxism). Often, the first indication is the noise created by the child grinding on their teeth during sleep.  One theory as to the cause involves a psychological component.  Stress due to a new environment, divorce, changes at school; etc. can influence a child to grind their teeth.  Another theory relates to pressure in the inner ear at night. If there are pressure changes (like in an airplane during take-off and landing, when people are chewing gum, etc. to equalize pressure) the child will grind by moving his jaw to relieve this pressure.</p>
    <p>The majority of cases of pediatric bruxism do not require any treatment.  The good news is most children outgrow bruxism. The grinding decreases between the ages 6-9 and children tend to stop grinding between ages 9-12. If you suspect bruxism, discuss this with your pediatrician or pediatric dentist.</p>

    <h3>Thumb Sucking</h3>
    <p>Sucking is a natural reflex and infants and young children may use thumbs, fingers, pacifiers and other objects on which to suck. It may make them feel secure and happy, or provide a sense of security at difficult periods. Since thumb sucking is relaxing, it may induce sleep.  Thumb sucking that persists beyond the age of three can cause problems with the proper growth of the mouth and tooth alignment. How intensely a child sucks on fingers or thumbs will determine whether or not dental problems may result. Children who rest their thumbs passively in their mouths are less likely to have difficulty than those who vigorously suck their thumbs.  Pacifiers are no substitute for thumb sucking. They can affect the teeth essentially the same way as sucking fingers and thumbs. However, use of the pacifier can be controlled and modified more easily than the thumb or finger habit. If you have concerns about thumb sucking or use of a pacifier, consult your pediatric dentist.</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>A few suggestions to help your child get through thumb sucking:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Children often suck their thumbs when feeling insecure. Focus on correcting the cause of anxiety, instead of the thumb sucking.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Children who are sucking for comfort will feel less of a need when their parents provide comfort.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Reward children when they refrain from sucking during difficult periods, such as when being separated from their parents.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Your pediatric dentist can encourage children to stop sucking and explain what could happen if they continue.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If these approaches don’t work, remind the children of their habit by bandaging the thumb or putting a sock on the hand at night. Your pediatric dentist may recommend the use of a mouth appliance.</p>

    <h3>What Is The Best Time For Orthodontic Treatment?</h3>
    <p>Developing malocclusions, or bad bites, can be recognized as early as 2-3 years of age. Often, early steps can be taken to reduce the need for major orthodontic treatment at a later age.</p>

    <h4>Stage I – Early Treatment:</h4>  
    <p>This period of treatment encompasses ages 2 to 6 years. At this young age, we are concerned with underdeveloped dental arches, the premature loss of primary teeth, and harmful habits such as finger or thumb sucking. Treatment initiated in this stage of development is often very successful and many times, though not always, can eliminate the need for future orthodontic/orthopedic treatment.</p>

    <h4>Stage II – Mixed Dentition:</h4> 
    <p>This period covers the ages of 6 to 12 years, with the eruption of the permanent incisor (front) teeth and 6 year molars.  Treatment concerns deal with jaw malrelationships and dental realignment problems. This is an excellent stage to start treatment, when indicated, as your child’s hard and soft tissues are usually very responsive to orthodontic or orthopedic forces.</p>

    <h4>Stage III Adolescent Dentition:</h4>
    <p>This stage deals with the permanent teeth and the development of the final bite relationship.</p>

   <h3> Early Infant Oral Care: Perinatal & Infant Oral Health</h3>

    <p>The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) and The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend that all pregnant women receive oral healthcare and counseling during pregnancy. Research has shown evidence that periodontal disease can increase the risk of preterm birth and low birth weight.  Additionally, mothers with poor oral health may be at a greater risk of passing the bacteria which causes cavities to their young children. Mother's should follow these simple steps to decrease the risk of spreading cavity-causing bacteria:</p>
    <p>Visit your dentist regularly.</p>
    <p>Brush and floss on a daily basis to reduce bacterial plaque.</p>
    <p>Proper diet, with the reduction of beverages and foods high in sugar & starch.</p>
    <p>Use a fluoridated toothpaste recommended by the ADA and rinse every night with an alcohol-free, over-the-counter mouth rinse with .05 % sodium fluoride in order to reduce plaque levels.</p>
    <p>Don't share utensils, cups or food which can cause the transmission of cavity-causing bacteria to your children.</p>
    <p>Use of xylitol chewing gum (4 pieces per day by the mother) can decrease a child’s caries rate.</p>

    <h3>Your Child's First Dental Visit-Establishing A "Dental Home"</h3>
    <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Dental Association (ADA), and the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) all recommend establishing a "Dental Home" for your child by 6 months of age.  Children who have a dental home are more likely to receive appropriate preventive and routine oral health care.  The Dental Home is intended to provide a place other than the Emergency Room for parents.  You can make the first visit to the dentist enjoyable and positive.  It is best if you refrain from using words around your child that might cause unnecessary fear, such as needle, pull, drill or hurt.  The doctors and staff at Bloomington Pediatric Dentistry make a practice of using words that convey the same message, but are pleasant and non-frightening to the child.</p>

    <h3>Baby Bottle Tooth Decay (Early Childhood Caries)</h3>
    <p>One serious form of decay among young children is baby bottle tooth decay.  This condition is caused by frequent and long exposures of an infant’s teeth to liquids that contain sugar.  Among these liquids are milk (including breast milk), formula, fruit juice and other sweetened drinks.  Putting a baby to bed for a nap or at night with a bottle other than water can cause serious and rapid tooth decay.  Sweet liquid pools around the child’s teeth giving plaque bacteria an opportunity to produce acids that attack tooth enamel.  If you must give the baby a bottle as a comforter at bedtime, it should contain only water. If your child won't fall asleep without the bottle and its usual beverage, gradually dilute the bottle's contents with water over a period of two to three weeks.  After each feeding, wipe the baby’s gums and teeth with a damp washcloth or gauze pad to remove plaque.  The easiest way to do this is to sit down, place the child’s head in your lap or lay the child on a dressing table or the floor.  Whatever position you use, be sure you can see into the child’s mouth easily.</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Sippy Cups</h3>
    <p>Sippy cups should be used as a training tool from the bottle to a cup and should be discontinued by the first birthday. If your child uses a sippy cup throughout the day, fill the sippy cup with water only (except at mealtimes). By filling the sippy cup with liquids that contain sugar (including milk, fruit juice, sports drinks, etc.) and allowing a child to drink from it throughout the day, it soaks the child’s teeth in cavity causing bacteria.</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>What are healthy snacks for my child?</h3>
    <p>Healthy eating habits lead to healthy teeth.  Like the rest of the body, the teeth, bones and the soft tissues of the mouth need a well-balanced diet.  Children should eat a variety of foods from the five major food groups.  Most snacks that children eat can lead to cavity formation.  The more frequently a child snacks, the greater the chances for tooth decay.  How long food remains in the mouth also plays a role.  For example, hard candy and breath mints stay in the mouth a long time, which cause longer acid attacks on tooth enamel. If your child must snack, choose nutritious foods such as vegetables, low-fat yogurt, and low-fat cheese, which are healthier and better for children’s teeth.</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>How Do I Prevent Cavities?</h3>
    <p>Good oral hygiene removes bacteria and the left over food particles that combine to create cavities. For infants, use a wet gauze or clean washcloth to wipe the plaque from their gums and soon as they have teeth start using a toothbrush to clean the teeth and gums.   Avoid putting your child to bed with a bottle filled with anything other than water.  If your baby feeds during the night – breastfeeds or bottle – wipe their cheeks, gums, and tongue after they feed to remove excess milk.  For older children, brush their teeth at least twice a day.  Do not allow them to go to bed with snacks or drinks other than water.   Also, watch the number of snacks containing sugar that you give your children.</p>
    <p>The AAPD recommends visits every six months to the pediatric dentist, beginning at six months of age. Routine visits will start your child on a lifetime of good dental health.</p>
    <p>Your pediatric dentist may also recommend protective sealants or home fluoride treatments for your child. Sealants can be applied to your child’s molars to prevent decay on hard to clean surfaces.</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Mouth Guards</h3>
    <p>When a child begins to participate in recreational activities and organized sports, injuries can occur. A properly fitted mouth guard, or mouth protector, is an important piece of athletic gear that can help protect your child’s smile, and should be used during any activity that could result in a blow to the face or mouth.</p>
    <p>Mouth guards help prevent broken teeth, and injuries to the lips, tongue, face or jaw. A properly fitted mouth guard will stay in place while your child is wearing it, making it easy for them to talk and breathe.</p>
    <p>Ask your pediatric dentist about custom and store-bought mouth protectors.</p>
