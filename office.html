    <p>Bloomington Pediatric Dentistry was designed to be a playground for a child’s imagination - a kind, gentle, creative environment that looks and feels nothing like a typical dental office. (Picture suggestions: Group 1: 52, 072, 080, 098, 103, 106, 121, 195, 207, 226; group 2: 2576, 2605, 2610, 2618, 2639, 2642, 2679, 2692, 2719, 2737)  Our walls come to life with the story of a brave boy named Jack and his wonderful adventures. (Picture suggestions: Group 1: 137, 139, 142)   Through his good deeds and bravery, Jack convinced the Giant of Floss and Brush Castle to share his wonderful kingdom with other brave boys and girls.

    <p>When you arrive at Floss and Brush Castle, (Picture of the outside of the building) you will enter through the Giant’s courtyard (pictures of entryway and waiting room).  In the courtyard, there are many things hidden for you to find. (picture of list of I spy stuff, stuff on walls)  You can even try finding Jack (picture of Jack)!  He likes to hide all over the Castle.  There are many different secret doors in the courtyard and depending why you are visiting the Floss and Brush Castle will determine which door you get to enter. </p>
     
     
    <p>Put picture of what goes above hygiene entrance door here. <br> 
      If you are coming to the Floss and Brush castle to get your teeth cleaned and checked, you will head to the Giant’s porch (pictures of hygiene area) where you can see for miles and miles around the castle.  (some great closeups of the circus, mountains and water, etc).  You can even sit in front of the fireplace where the Giant likes to cook his food and warm himself.  (Picture of fireplace).  If you are going to be getting pictures taken of your teeth, you will travel a short distance to the Kite Room.  (Pictures of xray room).  When you are all done, you will take the winding path past the toothbrush tree (picture of the toothbrush tree and hallway) to the Bell Tower (picture of the bell and checkout) to make your next appointment at the Floss and Brush Castle.  After you are comfortable with your visits to the Giant’s porch, your parents will come through another secret door (picture of the hygiene checkout door) to meet you at the Bell Tower after you are finished.</p>

      If you are coming to the Floss and Brush Castle for your checkup and you are not yet three years old, you will travel with your parents past the Giant’s clothes line (pictures of hallway and door), through another secret door and into the Giant’s fish tank (pictures) or into the Giant’s own Circus (pictures).  You will get to sit on your mom or dad’s lap on the Giant’s play benches (pictures of the benches) while one of our pediatric dentist’s counts your teeth.  Once you get to be a little bit bigger, you can try lying back on the Giant’s bench (picture of kid on the bench) for the dentist to count your teeth.  When you are big enough to do that, you will graduate to the big kid’s room – the Giant’s porch.  You will have so much fun there!</p>

      If you are coming to the Floss and Brush Castle so we can fix your teeth, you will travel past the Giant’s clothes line (pictures of the clothes), through another secret door and back to either the Giant’s Farm (pictures of the farm room), his Jungle (pictures of the Jungle room), his Glacier (Blue room pictures), or his secret island that he is still constructing.  Each of these rooms has a television on the ceiling (pictures of the tvs) that are just for you to watch!  You will decide on a channel – just make sure it is one you get to watch while you are at home too.  When you are all done and you have been very brave, you get to pick out a prize from the Castle Treasure bin (picture of the prizes).  Then you will head back by the Giant’s laundry and up to the scenic overlook (pictures of behind checkout mural) to meet your parents.
