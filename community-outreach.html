<div class="row">
  <div class="eight columns">
    <p>Our team at Bloomington Pediatric Dentistry strives to be an advocate for dental health in our community.  Our office enjoys traveling to surrounding daycares, preschools, and grades K-12 giving presentations that will not only leave them with great tips and facts about proper oral health care, but it also gets them excited to go home and try out their new learned information with  family and friends.  Our goal is to be heavily involved in keeping our community up to date with the general facts of proper oral healthcare as well as keep you informed of any new guidelines recommended by the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry.</p>
