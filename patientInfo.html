    <h2>Patient Info</h2>
    <p>Thank you for choosing Bloomington Pediatric Dentistry.  Please click on the links to the right to print off your new patient paperwork.  If you have more than one child please print off one packet per child.  Please bring this paperwork to your childâ€™s appointment along with their insurance card 15 minutes before their appointment time.  We will ask you to fill out three additional sheets upon arrival that require a signature.</p>

    <p>Again, thank you for choosing Bloomington Pediatric Dentistry.  If you have any questions please contact us at <strong>812.355.0855</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>As a reminder, a parent/guardian must stay on the premises while the child is being seen.  We ask that if you need to go to your car or want to step outside you inform the front patient care coordinator.  This is for the safety of your child.</p>
