    <blockquote class="right six"><div class="well"><p>"Good dental habits should begin before the first tooth appears.”  American Academy of Pediatrics</p></div></blockquote>
    <p>Bloomington Pediatric Dentistry follows a prevention based practice model.  Oral health is an integral part of your child’s overall health and well-being.  According to the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD), over 40% of children start kindergarten with tooth decay.  Our goal is to provide every advantage to our patients in the fight against tooth decay.  Starting with our Smile Baby! Born to be Cavity Free program for expectant parents and continuing with well visits at six month old and every six months thereafter, your family can become oral health experts!</p>
 
    <p>Other preventive services we provide to our patients include radiographs, sealants, and custom fluoride treatments.</p> 

    <hr id="sealants">
    <h3>Sealants</h3>
    <p>Sealants are one of the most effective preventive measures that can be taken to protect permanent teeth from cavities. By forming a thin covering over the deep grooves on the chewing surface of molars, sealants keep out plaque and food, thus decreasing the risk of decay. The American Dental Association (ADA) and the AAPD recognize that sealants can play an important role in the prevention of tooth decay. When properly applied and maintained, they can successfully protect the chewing surfaces of your child's teeth. A total prevention program includes regular visits to the dentist, the use of fluoride, daily brushing and flossing, and limiting the number of times sugar-rich foods are eaten. If these measures are followed and sealants are used on the child's teeth, the risk of decay can be reduced or may even be eliminated!</p>

    <hr id="fluride">
    <h3>Fluoride</h3>
    <p>The proper use of fluoride is one of the most successful prevention tools against tooth decay.  Bloomington Pediatric Dentistry follows the recommendations of the AAPD and the ADA on the use of fluoride.  As each child’s needs are different, a recommendation for fluoride use for your child will be discussed at your first visit.</p>   

    <hr id="radiographs">
    <h3>Radiographs (X-Rays)</h3>
    <p>Radiographs (X-Rays) are a vital and necessary part of your child’s dental diagnostic process and are usually taken once a year. Without them, certain dental conditions can and will be missed. Radiographs detect much more than cavities. For example, radiographs may be needed to survey erupting teeth, diagnose bone diseases, evaluate the results of an injury, or plan orthodontic treatment. Radiographs allow the dentists to diagnose and treat health conditions that cannot be detected during a visual exam. If dental problems are found and treated early, dental care is more comfortable for your child and more affordable for you. After your child’s first visit to our office, the doctor will discuss a plan for radiographs with you.</p>
    <p>In accordance with the AAPD the ADA, our office recommends taking radiographs based on the needs of the individual child. Some children have multiple risk factors which make them very susceptible to cavities. Therefore, these children need to be followed very closely and may need more frequent radiographs. Pediatric dentists are particularly careful to minimize the exposure of their patients to radiation. With contemporary safeguards, the amount of radiation received in a dental X-ray examination is extremely small. Dental radiographs represent a far smaller health risk than do undetected and untreated dental problems. Bloomington Pediatric Dentistry invests in the most current and up to date digital radiography systems in an effort to minimize your child’s exposure to radiation. We are the only pediatric dental office in the greater Bloomington area with this state of the art system.</p>

            <h4>Why fix baby teeth?</h4>
            <p>Primary teeth are not “just baby teeth.”  Neglected primary teeth increase cavity risk which often leads to life long problems with developing permanent teeth.</p>
        </div>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>If your child has cavities, the doctor will discuss in detail what will need to be done to restore the teeth and mouth back to a healthy state.  Our doctors follow the most up to date recommendations from research studies and recommendations from the AAPD.  Below are some of the options we have for restoring primary teeth.</p>

    <hr id="fillings">
    <h3>Tooth colored fillings</h3>
    <p>Tooth-colored fillings are made from durable plastics called composite resins.  Similar in color and texture to natural teeth, the fillings are less noticeable and more attractive than other types of fillings.  Certain tooth-colored filling materials (such as glass ionomers) even release fluoride, resulting in a tooth that is more resistant to decay.  In addition, tooth-colored fillings are compatible with dental sealants.  A tooth can be filled and sealed at the same time to provide extra decay protection.  Tooth colored fillings are not for every cavity. They work best in small areas of decay in low-stress areas.  Your pediatric dentist will discuss this option with you if it is right for your child’s needs and situation, based upon the guidelines of the AAPD. </p>  

    <hr id="crowns">
    <h3>Stainless steel crowns</h3>
    <p>Stainless steel crowns are the treatment choice when a primary molar (back tooth) has two or more decayed surfaces.  They have been used over 50 years to save teeth that otherwise would be lost or when other treatments would fail.  One of the strongest and most durable services in dentistry, they last longer than fillings. Despite many advances in pediatric dentistry, there still is not a better treatment for primary teeth with larger cavities, or a crown that is the color of a tooth instead of silver.  It is commonly misunderstood that a large filling would be much better for a baby tooth than a crown.  However, both scientific research published in peer reviewed journals and practical clinical research show that stainless steel crowns used on baby teeth with significant decay are three times as successful as using tooth colored fillings.  Further, the AADP practice guidelines cite potential for tooth fracture, postoperative sensitivity, nerve sensitivity, and abscess as potential outcomes for the use of fillings in primary teeth with substantial decay and only recommend a full coverage crown for a successful restoration.   If you have questions about the use of stainless steel crowns please talk to your pediatric dentist.  They will be happy to discuss your child's specific situation and why a stainless steel crown has been recommended.</p> 

    <hr id="pulpotomy">
    <h3>Pulpotomy (baby root canal or nerve treatment)</h3>
    <p>When a cavity has gotten close to or into the nerve of a baby tooth, it is necessary to treat the nerve of the tooth to avoid infection or sensitivity after the tooth is restored. A pulpotomy procedure involves removing the top portion of the nerve that has been closest to the cavity and replacing it with medicine that will help to soothe the nerve. The tooth then needs to be covered with a stainless steel crown to seal the tooth and help to keep it strong.</p>  

    <hr id="tooth-colored-crowns">
    <h3>Tooth colored crowns for front teeth</h3>
    <p>If your child has decay on their front teeth that is too large for a filling, your pediatric dentist will recommend a crown to help strengthen the remaining tooth structure.  Bloomington Pediatric Dentistry uses tooth colored crowns on front teeth.   </p>  

    <hr id="extractions">
    <h3>Extractions</h3>
    <p>If a tooth has been badly broken down due to tooth decay or has infection, the tooth will need to be removed.  If a severely decayed tooth or an infected tooth is not removed, the permanent tooth can be affected and the infection can spread to other parts of the body and become life threatening.  If your child ever has facial swelling due to a tooth ache take them to their dentist immediately to avoid any complications.</p>  

    <hr id="space-maintainers">
    <h3>Space maintainers</h3>
    <p>If your child has to have a primary tooth removed early, a space maintainer is used to keep other teeth from moving around and blocking out the permanent teeth from coming in correctly.  There are many different types of space maintainers that can be used and your doctor will discuss with you which one is appropriate for your child.</p>  

    <div id="sedation" />

        <div class="well"><p>Our doctors are affiliated with IU Health Bloomington Hospital, Southern Indiana Surgery Center, and Riley Hospital for Children.</p></div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>After your child’s dental treatment plan is discussed with you, the doctor will also discuss possible sedation options. Our goal is to make each treatment visit fun within the safest environment possible. Since each child has different needs, the recommendations made by our doctors will be based upon their professional assessment of your child’s personality, health history, and treatment needs.</p>
    
    <hr id="nitrous-oxide">
    <h3>Nitrous oxide</h3>
    <p>Nitrous oxide is also commonly known as “laughing gas”. It is a very safe sedation option for children undergoing dental procedures and is endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry. Nitrous oxide is not intended to put your child to sleep, only to help relax them.  At Bloomington Pediatric Dentistry we have a unique way of explaining its use to children. The delivery system is a soft nose that is placed over their nose so they can inhale the nitrous oxide/oxygen mixture. Throughout the procedure your child will be breathing less nitrous oxide and more oxygen and by the end of the procedure it will be only oxygen. Before your child leaves the dental chair all of the nitrous oxide is out of your child’s system and they feel as they did before we began the appointment.</p>

    <h5>What is nitrous oxide?</h5>
    <p>Nitrous oxide is a blend of two gases: oxygen and nitrous oxide. When inhaled, it is absorbed by the body and has a calming effect. Normal breathing eliminates nitrous oxide from the body.</p>

    <h5>How will my child feel when breathing nitrous oxide?</h5>
    <p>Your child will smell a sweet, pleasant aroma and experience a sense of well-being and relaxation. If your child is worried by the sights, sounds or sensations of dental treatment, he or she may respond more positively with the use of nitrous oxide.</p>

    <h5>Are there any special instructions for nitrous oxide/oxygen?</h5>
    <p>First, give your child little or no food before the dental visit. Occasionally, nausea or vomiting occurs when a child has a full stomach. Second, tell your pediatric dentist about any respiratory condition that makes breathing through the nose difficult for your child as it may limit the effectiveness of nitrous oxide. Third, tell your pediatric dentist if your child is taking any medication (prescription or over the counter) on the day of the appointment.</p>

    <h5>Will nitrous oxide work for all children?</h5>
    <p>Pediatric dentists know that all children are not alike and therefore nitrous oxide is not going to be effective for all children. Inability to breathe through their nose is one of the biggest reasons why nitrous oxide may not work for your child. If your child is too young to understand the directions to breathe through their nose, has anxiety so severe they cannot calm down to listen, nasal congestion, or nasal defects, nitrous oxide may not be successful. If any of these situations apply to your child, the doctor may discuss alternative sedation options with you.</p>

    <hr id="office-sedation">
    <h3>Office based anesthesia (IV sedation)</h3>
    <p>Some children, because of their young age or due to the large amount of treatment they require, would benefit from something more than what nitrous oxide can provide. Office based anesthesia, also known as IV sedation, is another option that the doctor may discuss with you. With office based anesthesia your child would be put to sleep for the dental procedure by a dentist anesthesiologist while the pediatric dentist completes the dental treatment – usually in one visit! If office based anesthesia is a treatment option for your child, you will be scheduled for an initial consultation with the dentist anesthesiologist. At this visit, the dentist anesthesiologist will review your child’s health history and make sure your child is a good candidate for office based anesthesia. It is also an opportunity for you to ask any questions you may have about office based anesthesia.</p>

    <h4>Common questions about office based sedation</h4>
    <h5>What is Office Based Anesthesia?</h5>
    <p>Office based anesthesia utilizes the training and experience of a dentist anesthesiologist to apply an appropriate level of anesthesia for your child’s treatment. The level of anesthesia may range from deep, complete sleep to brief relaxation, depending upon your child’s dental needs and overall health.</p>
    
    <h5>Who should be sedated?</h5>
    <p>Children with severe anxiety and/or the inability to relax are candidates for sedation.  Usually these children are young or have trouble managing their anxiety.</p>
    
    <h5>Why utilize Office Based Anesthesia?</h5>
    <p>Office based anesthesia aids in calming a child so that he/she can accept dental treatment in a more relaxed state. For children that need extensive treatment, office based anesthesia provides a way to finish treatment in one visit versus multiple visits.</p>
    
    <h5>What medications are used?</h5>
    <p>Many different agents can be used for office based anesthesia. The decision to use a particular drug or technique depends upon the unique needs of your child and the type of dental treatment to be performed. Dr. Saxen will discuss his recommendations and answer any questions you may have about the medications when you and your child meet with him for your initial consultation appointment.</p>
    
    <h5>Is sedation safe?</h5>
    <p>Office based anesthesia delivered by a dentist anesthesiologist has an excellent safety record. Pediatric dentists, by virtue of their training, are highly experienced in treating patients under anesthesia. Bloomington Pediatric Dentistry utilizes board certified dentist anesthesiologists to work with their staff in providing the highest level of safety for their office-based anesthesia.</p>
    
    <h5>What special instructions should I follow before and after the sedation appointment?</h5>
    <p>Prior to receiving anesthesia, you and your child will meet the dentist anesthesiologist to discuss preparation before anesthesia and also what to expect after anesthesia. A brief examination is performed on your child at that time while parents’ questions are addressed.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions about our office based anesthesia program please call our office and ask to speak to Natalie, our office based anesthesia treatment coordinator.<br/>
    
    <hr id="hospital-anes">
    <h3>Hospital based anesthesia (general anesthesia)</h3>
    <p>Not all children are candidates for office based anesthesia. The doctor may discuss with you the option of having your child sedated at the hospital with a medical anesthesiologist while a pediatric dentist completes the dental treatment. The Pediatric dentists at Bloomington Pediatric Dentistry are on staff at IU Health Bloomington Hospital, Southern Indiana Surgery Center, and Riley Hospital for Children and have privileges in the operating rooms at these facilities.   If you would like further information about our hospital based anesthesia program, please call our office and ask to speak with Jamie P., our hospital based anesthesia treatment coordinator.</p>
