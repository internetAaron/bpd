    <h3 id="preventive-services">Preventive Services</h3>
    <p>Bloomington Pediatric Dentistry follows a prevention based practice model.  Oral health is an integral part of your child’s overall health and well-being.  According to the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD), over 40% of children start kindergarten with tooth decay.  With each visit to Bloomington Pediatric Dentistry, you will be provided with tools and information to help keep your family healthy and cavity free.</p>    

    <p>Use some pics from Jana and Jody of smiling babies, toddlers, kids throughout the text.</p>

    <h4>When should my child start seeing a pediatric dentist?</h4>  
    <p>Many parents are uncertain when they should start taking their child to the dentist.  At Bloomington Pediatric Dentistry we follow the recommendations of both the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the AAPD on this subject.  Because a mother’s oral health has a direct impact on her pregnancy and her baby’s oral health, the AAP and the AAPD recommend prenatal oral health counseling (make this a link to the Smile Baby page) for expectant parents and baby’s first visit to the pediatric dentist by six months of age.  We will continue to see your child every six months following your first visit.</p>

    <hr id="sealants">
    <h3>Sealants</h3>
    <p>Sealants are one of the most effective preventive measures that can be taken to protect permanent teeth from cavities.   By forming a thin covering over the deep grooves on the chewing surface of molars, sealants keep out plaque and food, thus decreasing the risk of decay.  The American Dental Association (ADA) and the AAPD recognize that sealants can play an important role in the prevention of tooth decay.   When properly applied and maintained, they can success sfully protect the chewing surfaces of your child's teeth.</p>

    <p>A total prevention program includes regular visits to the dentist, the use of fluoride, daily brushing and flossing, and limiting the number of times sugar-rich foods are eaten.   If these measures are followed and sealants are used on the child's teeth, the risk of decay can be reduced or may even be eliminated!</p>

    <hr id="radiographs">
    <h3>Radiographs (X-Rays)</h3>
    <p>Radiographs (X-Rays) are a vital and necessary part of your child’s dental diagnostic process and are usually taken once a year. Without them, certain dental conditions can and will be missed.  Radiographs detect much more than cavities. For example, radiographs may be needed to survey erupting teeth, diagnose bone diseases, evaluate the results of an injury, or plan orthodontic treatment.  Radiographs allow the dentists to diagnose and treat health conditions that cannot be detected during a visual exam. If dental problems are found and treated early, dental care is more comfortable for your child and more affordable for you.  After your child’s first visit to our office, the doctor will discuss a plan for radiographs with you.</p>
    <p>In accordance with the AAPD the ADA, our office recommends taking radiographs based on the needs of the individual child.  Some children have multiple risk factors which make them very susceptible to cavities.  Therefore, these children need to be followed very closely and may need more frequent radiographs.  Pediatric dentists are particularly careful to minimize the exposure of their patients to radiation.  With contemporary safeguards, the amount of radiation received in a dental X-ray examination is extremely small.</p>  
    <p>Dental radiographs represent a far smaller health risk than do undetected and untreated dental problems.  Bloomington Pediatric Dentistry invests in the most current and up to date digital radiography systems in an effort to minimize your child’s exposure to radiation.  We are the only pediatric dental office in the greater Bloomington area with this state of the art system.</p>

    <hr id="fluride">
    <h3>Fluoride</h3>
    <p>The proper use of fluoride is one of the most successful tools against tooth decay.  Bloomington Pediatric Dentistry follows the recommendations of the AAPD and the ADA on the use of fluoride.  As each child’s needs are different, a recommendation for fluoride use for your child will be discussed at your first visit.</p>    

    <hr id="restorative">
    <h3>Restorative services</h3>
    <h4>Why fix baby teeth?</h4>
    <p>Primary teeth are not “just baby teeth.”  Neglected primary teeth increase cavity risk which often leads to life long problems with developing permanent teeth.</p>
          
    <h4>Primary teeth are important to:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Allow for proper chewing and eating</li>
      <li>Hold space for permanent teeth as they move into the correct position</li>
      <li>Permit normal development of the jaw bones and muscles</li>
      <li>Aid in the development of speech</li>
      <li>Add to an attractive appearance</li>
    </ul> 
    
    <p>While front teeth last until 6-8 years of age, back teeth (canines and molars) aren’t replaced until age 10-12. In other words, kids need their primary teeth for a long time! </p> 
    <p>If your child has cavities, the doctor will discuss in detail what will need to be done to restore the teeth and mouth back to a healthy state.  Our doctors follow the most up to date recommendations from research studies and recommendations from the AAPD.  Below are some of the options we have for restoring primary teeth.</p>

    <hr id="fillings">
    <h3>Tooth colored fillings</h3>
    <p>Tooth-colored fillings are made from durable plastics called composite resins.  Similar in color and texture to natural teeth, the fillings are less noticeable and more attractive than other types of fillings.  Certain tooth-colored filling materials (such as glass ionomers) even release fluoride, resulting in a tooth that is more resistant to decay.  In addition, tooth-colored fillings are compatible with dental sealants.  A tooth can be filled and sealed at the same time to provide extra decay protection.  Tooth colored fillings are not for every cavity. They work best in small areas of decay in low-stress areas.  Your pediatric dentist will discuss this option with you if it is right for your child’s needs and situation.</p>  

    <hr id="crowns">
    <h3>Stainless steel crowns</h3>
    <p>Stainless steel crowns are the treatment choice when a primary tooth has two or more decayed surfaces.  They have been used over 50 years to save teeth that otherwise would be lost or when other treatments would fail.  One of the strongest and most durable services in dentistry, they last longer than fillings. Their greatest disadvantage is that stainless steel crowns are not the color of teeth, but the color of polished silver.  Despite many advances in pediatric dentistry, there still is not a better treatment for primary teeth with larger cavities, or a crown that is the color of a tooth instead of silver.  It is commonly misunderstood that a large filling would be much better for a baby tooth than a crown.  It has even been said that prescribing crowns for baby teeth is overkill or overtreatment.  However, scientific research published in peer reviewed journals and practical clinical research both show that stainless steel crowns used on baby teeth with significant decay on one or more tooth surfaces are three times as successful as using tooth colored fillings.  Further, the AADP practice guidelines cite potential for tooth fracture, postoperative sensitivity, nerve sensitivity, and abscess as potential outcomes for the use of fillings in primary teeth with substantial decay and only recommend a full coverage crown for a successful restoration.   If you have questions about the use of stainless steel crowns please talk to your pediatric dentist.</p>  
    <hr id="pulpotomy">
    <h3>Pulpotomy (baby root canal or nerve treatment)</h3>
    <p>When a cavity has gotten close to or into the nerve of a baby tooth, it is necessary to treat the nerve of the tooth to avoid infection or sensitivity after the tooth is restored.  A pulpotomy procedure involves removing the top portion of the nerve that has been closest to the cavity and replacing it with medicine that will help to soothe the nerve.  The tooth then needs to be covered with a stainless steel crown to seal the tooth and help to keep it strong.</p>  

    <hr id="extractions">
    <h3>Extractions</h3>
    <p>If a tooth has been badly broken down due to tooth decay or has infection, the tooth will need to be removed.  If a severely decayed tooth or an infected tooth is not removed, the permanent tooth can be affected and the infection can spread to other parts of the body and become life threatening.  If your child ever has facial swelling due to a tooth ache take them to their dentist immediately to avoid any complications.</p>  

    <hr id="space-maintainers">
    <h3>Space maintainers</h3>
    <p>If your child has to have a primary tooth removed early, a space maintainer is used to keep other teeth from moving around and blocking out the permanent teeth from coming in correctly.  There are many different types of space maintainers that can be used and your doctor will discuss with you which one is appropriate for your child.</p>
