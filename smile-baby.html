 <h3>Why is Smile Baby! important?</h3>
<p>At Bloomington Pediatric Dentistry we want to give your family every advantage in the fight against tooth decay.  Most parents are not aware that establishing good oral health starts during pregnancy and continues the day your baby is born.  Much of the important work in establishing a healthy mouth is done even before you see your baby’s first tooth.  Because pregnancy and the early months of your baby’s life are such an important time in the fight against tooth decay, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) both recommend expectant parents have prenatal oral health counseling during pregnancy.  They also recommend bringing your baby to the pediatric dentist by six months of age for your first visit (even if they don't have any teeth!), and every six months thereafter.</p>
 
<h3>3 Important Lessons</h3>
<p>Bloomington Pediatric Dentistry’s <i>Smile Baby! Born to be Cavity Free is a FREE</i> prenatal oral health class offered in both English and Spanish, based upon the recommendations of the AAP and AAPD.   This class is designed for both expectant parents and new parents and will cover three important areas:</p> 
<ul class="leaf">
  <li><p>How the oral health of an expectant mother has an impact on her pregnancy and her child’s oral health; and why it is important and safe for a pregnant woman to see a dentist during pregnancy.</p></li>
  <li><p>How to care for your baby’s mouth when they are born and up until the time they start teething.</p></li>
  <li><p>How to care for your baby’s mouth once they have teeth.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Class participants will receive a complimentary oral health kit for both mom and newborn.
Please call our office if you have any questions or would like to sign up for one of our classes.  It will be one of the best things you did for your family!</p>
