    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p>Bloomington Pediatric Dentistry was founded in 2001 by <a class="various" data-fancybox-type="iframe" href="modal-includes/dr-taylor.html">Dr. Kyle Taylor</a> specializing in the comprehensive dental care of infants, children, adolescents and patients with special healthcare needs.  When Dr. Taylor created Bloomington Pediatric Dentistry, he had a vision that would change how children in Southern Indiana received dental care.  Bloomington Pediatric Dentistry was to be a state of the art, progressive practice using the most advanced treatment methods in a child centered environment.  This approach was to include cutting edge digital radiography equipment so as to minimize each child’s exposure during radiographs.   With his vision and expertise, Bloomington Pediatric Dentistry has successfully made that vision into a reality and added a few perks along the way.</p>            
 
    <p>In 2006, Dr. Taylor felt in order to better accommodate our patients and parents he needed to improve the office’s availability and provide some diversity in the style of care.  Dr. Taylor contacted the pediatric dental faculty at the respected Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis in search of a pediatric dentist.  After an overwhelming positive recommendation of <a class="various" data-fancybox-type="iframe" href="modal-includes/dr-gierke.html">Dr. Tamara Gierke</a>, Dr. Taylor brought Dr. Gierke on board as an associate in 2008.  Dr. Gierke, now a partner of Bloomington Pediatric Dentistry since 2011, has been a valuable asset to this practice.  Her knowledge, determination, and loving spirit have allowed Bloomington Pediatric Dentistry to soar with success in our education programs and quality of care.</p>
 
    <p>Both Dr. Taylor and Dr. Gierke are very proud of the newly completed office and all it has to offer to the children and families of southern Indiana.   Our doctors strive to always put the children first which is why they have made our new office into a magical remake of Jack and the Beanstalk, with the help of local painters Ruth, Cindy, and Cheryl Hester of Lettuce Paint (link to website).  Our story begins as soon as you walk into our office – The “Floss and Brush Castle”.  Both children and parents alike enjoy finding hidden items that are intricately painted on the walls relating to the story of Jack and the Beanstalk along with some healthy foods and other castle related items.  These are all located in the “giant’s courtyard,” otherwise known as our waiting room!  Throughout our castle, the storybook of beautiful art unravels in every room allowing the children to lose themselves in imagination.  When Dr. Taylor was designing the original Bloomington Pediatric Dentistry space back in 2001, his goal was to have a kid friendly activity that would help the children get excited to come to the dentist and possibly ease the anxiety that most of them portray.  The ‘’I Spy” concept  was such a huge success, Dr. Taylor and Dr. Gierke both wanted that “magic” carried throughout the new space.</p>               
 
    <p>Once again in an effort to improve the office’s availability and expand the services offered, Dr. Taylor and Dr. Gierke began the search for another pediatric dentist in 2011.  Fellow Riley Hospital for Children trained pediatric dentist <a class="various" data-fancybox-type="iframe" href="modal-includes/dr-john.html">Dr. Orbito “John” Patangan</a> was brought on board in May 2012 after finishing a distinguished career in the Navy. </p>
 
    <p>Dr. Taylor, Dr. Gierke, and newly added Dr. Orbito “John” Patangan  are very excited to see what the future holds for Bloomington Pediatric Dentistry.  The doctors and staff will continue to work toward improving the oral health of the children in Southern Indiana by providing better access, streamlined care, and educational prevention. </p>
