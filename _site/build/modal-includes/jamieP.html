    <p>Jamie graduated from Bedford North Lawrence in 2001 and has worked in the dental field ever since.  Jamie started her journey at Bloomington Pediatric Dentistry on March 28th, 2005 as a receptionist.  During those years she worked hard focusing on learning how the billing department worked, including the ever changing world of dental insurance.  Jamie is now our Billing and Insurance Coordinator.   In addition, Jamie is also the coordinator for the Bloomington Pediatric Dentistry Hospital Based Anesthesia Program, which includes scheduling at Indiana University Health Bloomington Hospital, Southern Indiana Surgery Center, and most recently Riley Hospital for Children.  She works with the families of children that will be having their dental work done at the hospital under general anesthesia and ensures all of the proper paperwork is on file at the hospitals for the day of surgery.  Bloomington Pediatric Dentistry has grown tremendously along the way and Jamie is proud to say she has been a part of the journey.  Jamie is from Springville, and currently lives there with her husband of 11 years.  She has a son that is 7 years old and a daughter that is 3 months old.  Jamie enjoys spending time with her family and friends, shopping, and riding quads.</p>
