    <p>Stephanie joined Bloomington Pediatric Dentistry in July of 2011 as a Patient Care Coordinator.  She is a native of Southern Indiana and a mother of two.  Stephanie strives to ensure that each and every patient and their parents have a positive experience as soon as they walk through the door.  It is her smiling face you will see greeting you when you come into our office!  Stephanie takes pride in keeping our office tidy and on schedule.  It is not uncommon to see Stephanie asking kids how their appointments went after they are done, especially if she talked to them on the way in and sensed some apprehension.  She enjoys spending time with her family and friends, crafting, and hanging out with her brother. </p>
