    <p>Jami is our Patient Care Coordinator in the dental hygiene checkout area of the Floss and Brush Castle. She was homeschooled through high school and went to college in Montana.  In her spare time she rides her four-wheeler and takes her Chihuahua “Mishka” on hikes through the trails.  Jami’s favorite thing about working for Bloomington Pediatric Dentistry is being with fun colleagues and seeing all of the smiling children.  Jami has a working knowledge of the Spanish language and enjoys helping Spanish speaking parents with paperwork and setting up appointments.</p>
