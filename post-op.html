            <p>Your child will be numb for 2-3 hours.  Please be aware that this numbness feels funny to your child and they may even complain of discomfort.  He/She may chew, bite, suck, or rub the area that is numb.  Please do not allow your child to do this as it will cause injury or discomfort after the numbness wears off.  A self-inflicted bite injury is the most common post-op complication. Please keep an eye on your child!</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>If your child does bite/chew his/her cheek, it may swell and you may notice a white area on the inside cheek or tongue area.  These white areas are oral scabs.  There is no treatment for this other than to allow this area to heal on it’s own.  This may take 5-7 days.  Children’s pain reliever or a topical numbing spray may help with the discomfort. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>We will send extra cotton rolls/ “tooth pillows” home for your child to bite on.  These will help to keep him/her from biting their cheek.  Please try to have your child bite on the cotton rolls until their numbness has gone away.  When the cotton becomes soaked with saliva you may replace with a dry one.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>If your child shows signs of pain or discomfort, you may choose to administer an over-the-counter children’s pain reliever such as Tylenol, Advil, or Motrin as directed on the bottle.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>If your child received a stainless steel crown/ “silver cap” be aware that the gum tissue around the crown may be sore or inflamed.  Keep this area clean with normal brushing and flossing to avoid further inflammation.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Helping your child to take care of their dental work is important. Your child should avoid sticky candies, a few examples of such candies include Now and Laters, Tootsie Rolls, Carmel, Laffy Taffy, Milk Duds, Sugar Daddies, Gummi Bears, Bit O Honey and Jolly Ranchers. Also gums containing sugar should be avoided.</p>

          <li><p>After having a tooth extracted, your child will be numb for 2-3 hours.  Please be aware that this numbness feels funny to your child.  He/she may chew, bite, suck, or rub the cheek or area that is numb.  Please do not allow them to do this as they may cause injury or discomfort to their cheek.</p></li>
          <li><p>Do not allow the child to eat until the numbness wears off.  A self-inflicted bite injury is the most common post-op complication, please keep an eye on your child!</p></li>
          <li><p>Your child is biting on a piece of gauze.  We will send you home with extra.  Please make sure your child is biting on this gauze to apply constant pressure to the extraction site, this will slow the bleeding and eventually stop it.  Please change the gauze when the piece your child is biting on becomes saturated.  Remove the old piece and discard, take a clean piece and fold it into quarters and place into the spot where the tooth was removed.  When you take out gauze when that looks fairly clean (very little blood) you should stop using the gauze.  If bleeding persists for longer that 3-4 hours please call our office for further instructions.</p></li>
          <li><p>Please do not allow your child to use a straw for the rest of today.  The suction can possibly dislodge the clot that has formed in the extraction site.</p></li>
          <li><p>When you get home please give your child a pain reliever such as children’s Tylenol, Advil or Motrin as directed, before the numbness wears off to keep your child from experiencing any discomfort.</p></li>
          <li><p>Your child should eat only soft, bland food for the first couple days-nothing sharp, crunchy or too hot or cold because the area may be sensitive.  Encourage plenty of liquids (Water, soups, juices, etc.)</p></li>
          <li><p>A clean mouth heals faster.  Gentle brushing around the extraction site can be started this evening.</p></li>

      <dt id="crowns"><hr><h3>Stainless Steel Crown</h3></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Please Be Aware</p>
 
        <p>When your child receives a stainless steel crown or “silver cap” it is important that they avoid things that can cause the cap to come off. Also please advise others such as grandparents and teachers that your child has a crown and they should avoid sticky, chewy foods or candies.</p>
         
        <p>Examples of these sticky, chewy foods and candies are as follows:  Tootsie Rolls, Laffy Taffy, Now and Laters, Carmel, Gummi Bears or Worms, Milk Duds, Bit O Honey, Jolly Ranchers, Sugar Babies, Sugar Daddies, etc…</p>
         
        <p>Should your child’s crown ever come off please keep the crown and contact our office duirng regular hours so that we can replace it.  Please be sure to bring the crown to this appointment.</p>

      <dt id="sealants"><hr><h3>Sealants</h3></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>The American Dental Association recognizes that sealants can play an important role in the prevention of tooth decay. When properly applied and maintained, they can successfully protect the chewing surfaces of your child's teeth.  A total prevention program includes regular visits to the dentist, the use of fluoride, daily brushing and flossing, and limiting the number of times sugar-rich foods are eaten. If these measures are followed and sealants are used on the child's teeth, the risk of decay can be reduced or may even be eliminated!</p>
 
        <p>After having sealants placed, your child’s teeth will feel slick, and they may even say that it feels like their teeth do not fit together as they did before.  This is normal, and their bite will adjust to the changes.</p> 
         
        <p>Helping your child to take care of their sealants is important. To protect the sealants he/she should refrain from eating ice or hard candy. This tends to fracture the sealant. Your child should also avoid sticky candies, a few examples of such candies include Now and Laters, Carmel, Laffy Taffy, Gummi Bears,  Milk Duds, Sugar Daddies, Bit O Honey and Jolly Ranchers. Also gums containing sugar should be avoided.  These candies can pull the sealant from the biting surface of the tooth.</p>   
         
        <p>Your child’s sealants will be checked during future routine exams to insure that they have not been fractured or pulled from the tooth.</p>

      <dt id="space-maintainers"><hr><h3>Space Maintainers</h3></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Your child has received a space maintainer.  A spacer will help to hold space where a tooth has been removed so that the permanent tooth will have room to erupt.   The spacer consists of a ring that was custom fit to your child’s tooth at a previous appointment and a loop that stretches across the span of the spot where the missing tooth used to be, and this loop will touch the tooth in front of the space.</p>
 
        <p>After placing a spacer, your child may complain that it feels tight.  This can be the case if the tooth behind the space has slightly shifted forward since we took the impression for the spacer at a previous appointment.  This tooth will shift back into place with the placement of the spacer.  Children’s pain reliever can be administered to reduce this discomfort.</p> 
         
        <p>Helping your child to take care of their space maintainer is important. Your child should avoid sticky candies, a few examples of such candies include Now and Laters, Carmel, Laffy Taffy, Milk Duds, Sugar Daddies, Gummi Bears, Bit O Honey and Jolly Ranchers. Also gums containing sugar should be avoided.</p> 
         
        <p>Your child’s space maintainers will be checked during future routine exams to insure that they have not been loosened from the tooth, or that the tooth, which the space is being held for, hasn’t begun to come in.</p>
