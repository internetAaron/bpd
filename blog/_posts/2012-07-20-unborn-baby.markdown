#### Dental decay is an infectious disease that is almost completely preventable.

The prevention of Early Childhood Caries, also known as cavities, begins before and right after your baby is born. Mothers or caregivers that have high levels of Streptococcus Mutans have a greater chance of passing the bacteria to their child. Streptococcus Mutans, otherwise known as SM, is a bacteria that lives in the mouth and causes tooth decay. It produces plaque and acids that break down the tooth enamel and causes decay.

SM can be given from the caregiver to the child. Lowering the levels of SM in the expectant mother by visiting the dentist and practicing good oral hygiene can prevent or delay the development of decay for the child. SM can also be transmitted to the child from family members or groups such as daycare by saliva sharing activities. Eliminating all saliva sharing activities, such as cup sharing and sharing of mouthed toys, may help decrease the infant or toddler’s chances of getting the bacteria SM.

Studies show that certain daily activities can contribute to your child’s rate of decay. Nicotine use promotes the growth of the bacteria that can cause decay. When mothers or others who smoke kiss children, they may pass on these bacteria. It is very important to live in a smoke free environment not only to protect your child’s teeth but also to protect overall health.

All expecting women should be advised to love good nutrition during their third trimester. There is considerable evidence that malnutrition during the prenatal period causes hypoplasia. Hypoplasia is a decrease in the amount of enamel formed, resulting in pits and grooves of the enamel. This type of defect may cause tooth sensitivity, may be unsightly, or may lead to dental cavities.

Oral Health education provided by a dentist or other health care provider can help prevent these issues. In addition, every infant should receive an oral health risk assessment by six months of age.

By one year of age parents or caregivers should establish a dental home. It is extremely important to find a dentist that you and your child feel comfortable with.

###Infant Oral Care

####0-3 months

Good oral hygiene starts the day your baby is born! It is recommended that baby’s mouth be cleaned regularly from day one to get baby accustomed to a regular teeth cleaning routine. Use a wet wash cloth and gently rub baby’s gums and clean the top surface of their tongue. This can help keep your baby’s mouth clean and help avoid infections such as thrush.

####3-6 months

Continue to clean baby’s mouth with a wet wash cloth. If your baby is teething you might notice him being more irritable, drooling excessively, and putting his fingers or hand in his mouth. Cutting teeth can be an uncomfortable process for your baby. You can gently massage gums or use teething toys to soothe their pain. Be cautious with using any gels that relieve teething pain by numbing the mouth; your child could bite their cheek or tongue if they can’t feel it.

####6-9 months

If the first tooth has erupted continue to use a wet wash cloth to cleanse tooth/teeth and/or introduce a soft bristle toothbrush. Training toothpaste is available for use. It is ideal for babies to use training paste without fluoride until the age of 2. The parent or guardian should be brushing baby’s teeth twice daily; once in the morning and once after the last feeding. After the teeth have been brushed at bedtime water should be the only liquid ingested. Oral health counseling is offered and advised around 6 months of age.

####9-23 months

Use a soft bristle toothbrush with training paste twice daily. Again, brush once in the morning and once after the last feeding. If you cannot see space in-between the teeth you need to introduce floss. Flossing children’s teeth can be a challenge. Floss sticks, which are easy for the parent/guardian to hold, are available at most grocery or drug stores. By 12 months of age you should have a dental home established for your child. Two checkups a year are recommended for good oral health.

####24 months

You can begin to use toothpaste with fluoride twice a day even if your child does not know how to spit. If you limit the amount used to the size of a pea, there are no concerns if all of that is swallowed. Only use toothpaste that has the American Dental Association seal of approval. Never use toothpastes with whiteners or tarter control; these are too strong for your child! It is a good idea to treat fluoride toothpaste like a medicine in your home. Keep it out of a child’s reach and only an adult should dispense it.
