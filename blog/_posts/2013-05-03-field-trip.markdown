<img src="/images/blog/morgan-co-bus.jpg" alt="" class="right">Owen County Head Start had a field trip day to Bloomington Pediatric Dentistry! Our staff was extremely excited when Owen County Head Start reached out to us with interest of visiting.  This was our first “office field trip!”   When they arrived we let them explore in our castle waiting room.  Our castle walls contain a series of ISPY images.  The children absolutely loved being able to find all of our hidden items!  The children then took a short tour throughout our office.  They were able to see where children get their teeth cleaned as well as our arctic room.  As the children walked around they were able to talk to some of our staff members and ask questions.  From there, they were guided to our presentation area.  Natalie, our infant dental educator, performed  an informative presentation covering oral hygiene.  <img src="/images/blog/natalie-teaching.jpg" alt="" class="left">She provided them with great tips, ideas, and facts that would be  helpful for the children to understand the importance of good oral hygiene!  The children did a wonderful job and we enjoyed having them at Bloomington Pediatric Dentistry very much! 

 

 If taking a field trip to our office is something that you think your children based company might be interested in please call our office at 812.355.0855 and ask for Nicole.  We would love to have you!  Keep an eye out for blog postings about our new FREE educational classes for pregnant women and parents of school aged children covering oral hygiene!  Have a wonderful day!
