I hope everyone was able to support National Doughnut Day last Friday.  I did my best.  With the latest east coast craze of the cronut to Dunkins glazed donut breakfast sandwich, why can we not just keep a little tradition and tweak the classics. 

My latest dilemma and “huh” moment occurred recently when the doughnut aficionado in training at my house asked for doughnut holes and diet coke for breakfast.  I said you need something a little healthier than diet coke, how about orange juice.  Sold.  Afterwards I began to think about the sugar content in the orange juice.  Was it better to give more sugar and acidity of orange juice or no sugar, acidity, and fake sweeteners of the diet coke?  Either way I won points with the serve yourself no limit on doughnut holes breakfast.  Don’t worry; we threw in some fruits and veggies at lunch.
